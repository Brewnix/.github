# Brewnix Organization

Welcome to the Brewnix! We're building a comprehensive, open-source infrastructure management platform for private networks and SME deployments.

## 🌟 What is Brewnix?

Brewnix provides a unified framework for deploying and managing various server types on bare metal infrastructure:

- **Proxmox NAS**: Network Attached Storage with virtualization capabilities
- **Proxmox Firewall**: Advanced network security and firewall management
- **K3s Cluster**: Lightweight Kubernetes for edge computing and container orchestration

## 📚 Our Repositories

### Core Components

- [**brewnix-template**](https://github.com/Brewnix/brewnix-template) - Main template repository with unified workflows
- [**proxmox-nas**](https://github.com/Brewnix/proxmox-nas) - NAS server deployment and management
- [**proxmox-firewall**](https://github.com/Brewnix/proxmox-firewall) - Firewall server deployment and management
- [**k3s-cluster**](https://github.com/Brewnix/k3s-cluster) - Kubernetes cluster deployment and management

### Tools & Utilities

- [**brewnix-web-ui**](https://github.com/Brewnix/brewnix-web-ui) - Web-based management interface
- [**brewnix-ansible**](https://github.com/Brewnix/brewnix-ansible) - Ansible playbooks and roles
- [**brewnix-terraform**](https://github.com/Brewnix/brewnix-terraform) - Infrastructure as Code modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Choose your server type** and fork the appropriate repository
2. **Configure your deployment** using our template system
3. **Deploy automatically** with GitOps workflows
4. **Manage via web UI** or command line tools

```bash
# Get started with the template
git clone https://github.com/Brewnix/brewnix-template.git
cd brewnix-template
./scripts/build-release.sh build config/sites/my-site.yml
```

## 🎯 Mission

To democratize infrastructure management by providing:

- **Free, open-source** tools for private network deployments
- **Unified workflows** across different server types
- **Enterprise-grade** reliability and security
- **Community-driven** development and support
